# üéµ Playcard Audio Server

A lightweight Flask web app to browse and stream `.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.mp4` audio files from a local folder.  
Supports OpenGraph previews (ideal for Discord, Telegram, etc.).

## ‚ú® Features

- Browse and play audio files from a specified directory
- Auto-generated player pages with OpenGraph metadata
- Social-media-ready previews (og:image, og:title, og:audio)
- Built-in rate limiting (100 req/min per IP)
- Unicode-safe, locale-aware filename sorting
- Minimal dependencies, runs with a single script

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Python dependencies

You can install dependencies via `pip`:

```bash
pip install flask flask-limiter
```

Or via `apt` (recommended on Debian/Ubuntu):

```bash
sudo apt install python3-flask python3-flask-limiter
```

### 2. Set your audio path:

```bash
export AUDIO_PATH="/absolute/path/to/your/audio/files"
```

### 3. Run the server:

```
python3 playcard_server.py
```

By default the app runs on: `http://127.0.0.1:8010`

## üìÇ Accessing Music

- Browse all tracks:  
  `http://localhost:8010/music/playcard`

- Direct play (example):  
  `http://localhost:8010/music/playcard?title=yourfile&ext=mp3`

- If a cover image named `yourfile.jpg` exists, it will be used for previews.

---

## üåê OpenGraph Preview Example

When shared on platforms like Discord:

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Track Title">
<meta property="og:audio" content="https://yourdomain.com/music/playcard?...">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/path/to/cover.jpg">
```

---

## üîê Security Notes

- Rate limited (100 requests/minute per IP)
- Input sanitized via `os.path.basename`
- Only .mp3, .ogg, .mp4 served
- No directory traversal possible
- Files must exist inside `AUDIO_PATH`

---

## üîß Configuration

Either:

- Set `AUDIO_PATH` as environment variable  
  or
- Modify `MEDIA_DIRS` list directly in `playcard_server.py`

```apache
# Example for Apache configuration


# Make sure that CGI is activated

<Directory ‚Äú/usr/lib/cgi-bin‚Äù>

    AllowOverride None

    Options +ExecCGI

    AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .py

    Require all granted

</Directory>


# Example for proxy configuration

<IfModule mod_proxy.c>

    # Forward requests for /music/folder to the Flask server

    ProxyPass ‚Äú/playcard‚Äù ‚Äúhttp://127.0.0.1:8010/playcard‚Äù

    ProxyPassReverse ‚Äú/playcard‚Äù ‚Äúhttp://127.0.0.1:8010/playcard‚Äù

</IfModule>


# **Your Audio Path Configuration** 

# Replace the path with the path to your music folder, e.g. /var/www/html/music/

# Make sure that the Python server has access to this folder

```

## Nginx configuration
Example configuration for Nginx:

If you are using Nginx, you can use the following configuration in your Nginx configuration file (/etc/nginx/sites-available/default or another file):

```nginx
# Example for Nginx configuration

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com; # Replace with your actual domain name or IP address

    location /music/playcard {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8010/musik/playcard; # Forward to the Flask server
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    # **Your Audio Path Configuration** 
    # Replace the path with the path to your music folder, e.g. /var/www/html/music/ogg
    # Make sure that the Python server has access to this folder
}
```


## Important notes:

### Audio path:
Make sure the Python server has access to the music folder you specified in the AUDIO_PATH in your Python script. The Apache or Nginx server must also have access to this folder so that the files can be delivered correctly.

### Proxy configuration:
The Apache and Nginx configurations forward requests for /music/playcard to the local Flask server running at http://127.0.0.1:8010. If you change the port or address, make sure you adjust the configuration accordingly.

### Testing:
After the configuration, you can restart your Apache or Nginx server:

    sudo systemctl restart apache2
    sudo systemctl restart nginx

### Troubleshooting:
If you have problems loading the music files, check that the music files are in the correct folder and that the web server (Apache/Nginx) has the correct permissions to access this folder.

## Systemd configuration for the automatic start of the Playcard server

To ensure that the Flask server starts automatically when booting and runs in the background, you can create a Systemd service. Here is an example of a playcard.service file.
### Step 1: Create the systemd service file

Create a new service file for the Flask server:
```bash
sudo vi /etc/systemd/system/playcard.service
```
Add the following configuration to the file:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Playcard Flask Service
After=network.target

[Service]
User=www-data
Group=www-data
WorkingDirectory=/usr/lib/cgi-bin
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/playcard_server.py
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
Environment="FLASK_ENV=production"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
If /usr/lib/cgi-bin/playcard_server.py is not located there, adjust the path accordingly.

### Step 2: Reload the systemd services and start the service



After you have created the service file, you can reload the service and start the Flask server:
```bash
# Reload systemd services
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# Start Flask server
sudo systemctl start playcard.service

# Configure Flask server to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable playcard.service
```
### Step 3: Checking the service status

You can check the status of the Flask server to ensure that the service is running correctly:
```bash
sudo systemctl status playcard.service
```
If the server is running successfully, you should see something like this

‚óè playcard.service - Playcard Flask Service
 Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/playcard.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
 Active: active (running) since <timestamp>; <time> ago
 Main PID: <PID> (python3)
 CGroup: /system.slice/playcard.service
 ‚îî‚îÄ<PID> /usr/bin/python3 /usr/lib/cgi-bin/playcard_server.py

### Step 4: Troubleshooting

If the service does not start, you can view the logs with journalctl to detect possible errors:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u playcard.service
```
With these instructions, you can start the Playcard server automatically and ensure that it is running when the system boots.

If you still want to make adjustments to the configuration, such as the user or the path to your script, you can do this in the playcard.service file.

## Remarks

### Environment variable for the audio path:
The path to the music file is set by AUDIO_PATH = os.environ.get("AUDIO_PATH", None). If this value is not set, the error "Server not configured. Please set AUDIO_PATH as an environment variable." is returned, informing the user that they must set the path.

### Allowed file extensions:
Only .mp3, .mp4 and .ogg are accepted as permitted audio formats. This ensures that no unwanted or dangerous file types are served.

### File and title matching:
The script checks whether the requested file exists in the specified AUDIO_PATH and whether it has the correct file extensions. If no file is specified, a list of available tracks is displayed.

### Open Graph (OG) meta tags:
When the page is shared on social media, OG metadata is included to create an engaging preview, including a cover image and audio file.

### Limiting:
The Flask Limiter extension ensures that the number of requests per IP address is limited to 100 per minute.

### File access check:
Checks whether the requested file actually exists in the specified directory and whether access to the file is allowed (avoiding security issues such as directory traversal).

## Further notes:

If you are using the script in a production environment, remember to take the appropriate security measures, e.g. enforce HTTPS, and make sure that sensitive data is not exposed in logs or error messages.

Secure it against cross-site scripting in Apache with mod_security.
